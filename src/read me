Working:
Multiple pages, direct submit, QR code, 3 different types of prompts, data is saved when navigating between pages, clear page button
Not working:
Page clear will likely only clear the information in the "Submit" Page, when reloading the web app when on any page other then "home" causes an error (because going to a different page causes the URL to change, and GitHub only hosts one URL, the one that leads to the Home page)
